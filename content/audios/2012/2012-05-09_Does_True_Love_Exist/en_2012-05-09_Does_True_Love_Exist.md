Does true love exist?

  #00:00:24#

Glorification of the teachers.

  #00:01:55#

So we welcome our dear Raseswari from Mother
Russia, which reminds me of a joke they tell, that I wish I could tell. But
it’s a Russian joke, so you can imagine what it is, but it is pretty funny.
Hare Krishna.

  #00:02:28#

Anyway, any question from anyone? Yes.

  #00:02:28#

Q: I wonder if you can explain what is
subjective thinking in our Krishna Conscious conception and also compared to
what material world estimates subjective thinking. It seems to be two different
things, and if you can clarify that.

  #00:03:04#

Srila B.S. Goswami Maharaj: I don’t know if
I can. But I can try, just I mean, that’s not like in quotes “subjective
thinking”, cause if that’s within somebodies system, or something, or it’s a
phrase that people use…

  #00:03:25#

Q: Just the word “subjective” and what that
means, [in the outside world?] and what that means to us…

  #00:03:29#

Form vs. substance

  #00:03:30#

Goswami Maharaj: Yes, okay, well then that I
can say. Because it’s one of Srila Guru Maharaja’s themes. We say subjective,
objective or form vs. substance, is what it’s really about. Form vs. Substance.
Form in contrast to substance.

  #00:04:00#

So interestingly just as some back story,
when we were publishing books for Guardian of Devotion Press, I thought at the
time with folded palms and a bowed head, that we should think of a way that
would make the contents most accessible to the audience, for those who might
read the books, beyond our devotees. For devotees also, but thinking beyond
then, so we’ll give some attention to the form, cause Srila Guru Maharaj is
known for this form vs. substance theme and always siding [on the sign/side?]
of Substance over Form. But we have to listen carefully to everything he says,
and he will say, we will qualify that by saying, “If there is a clash, a
conflict between form and substance, we side with substance ”.

  #00:05:17#

So anyway we made these books, and we try to
make them, the form of the books as nice as possible, and stylistically, and
another considerations. So then later some of devotees in India, at the Math,
they got some inspiration, and they wanted to start publishing. And then some
consideration came about whether they should spend money to buy new fonts or…
this is all pre-Internet, pre-digital. So someone thinking that they would
curry the favour of Srila Gurur Maharaj, they said, they argued that the form
is not so important, it’s the substance of the book, that’s what matters, how
they’re presented formally we’re not so much concerned with that. And they
thought that Guru Maharaj will say, “Oh, yes, he has the right understanding.”
But Guru Maharaj ever want to surprise, not to be stereotyped, he disagreed.
And he said, with his use of analogy and example, which he is noted for, he
said, “Our goal is Vrindavan.” Radhika madhava syam, ostensibly (?) that’s the
goal of all Gaudia-vaisnavas is the highest aspect of the Vaikuntha world, the
adhokshaja-world, lower hemisphere, Vaikuntha, the upper hemisphere, the
highest, Goloka, Vrindavan. So Guru Maharaj said, “In Vrindavan, form and
substance are one, they are identical.” That’s why we say, the trees, the
plants, the flowers, they are all chinmoy. Vaikunthera-pritty-vyadi-sakala-chinmoy.
Everything in the spiritual world, it’s
form is an expression of its dedicating tendency. As here body is the
biological expression of the soul’s delusion. That’s why there is jala-jan-nava-lakhani-stavra-laka-binkshati.
Padma-purana is saying, eight million four hundred thousand species. Don’t
trip out on the numbers, if you take three colours, RGB, or red, yellow, blue,
whichever one you want to deal with, and start combining them you’ll get how
many variations? Millions. So taking these three tama, raja, sattva. Millions
of variations. That’s what they’re telling you. Body is the biological expression of the soul’s delusion, it’s the
outcome of exploiting tendency. 

  #00:08:35#

bhūmir
āpo ’nalo vāyuḥkhaṁ mano
buddhir eva caahaṅkāra
itīyaṁ mebhinnā prakṛtir
aṣṭadhā(Bhagavad-gita:
7.4)

  #00:08:46#

Saying these elements, these mundane
elements, formal (?) body, the gross body, that is built upon subtle body,
which is based upon ego, so it’s all… And what is that ego tendency?
Kartha-ham-iti-manyate, another Gita śloka. What does it say?

  #00:09:15#

prakṛteḥ
kriyamāṇāniguṇaiḥ karmāṇi
sarvaśaḥahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmākartāham iti
manyate(Bhagavad-gita:
3.27)

  #00:09:32#

I’ll say it again ahankar, ego, the ego of
exploitation, exploiting tendency, hrd-rogam, the heart infused with consumer
tendency, expressing that. The exploiting tendency, body is generated from
there. But there is another world, what is it? Parastasmat-tabhavanyo, jivadbhuta
sanatana, but beyond this world, there is another world where the body is based
upon dedicating tendency. So Guru Maharaj said, “In that plane form and
substance are one.”

  #00:10:18#

And I was just remembering, when I first
went to the temple, the Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple, in Haight-Ashbury, in
1969, December of 1969. The devotees… and I say this with affection Trivikram
Maharaj, he gets some joy, when I say, my, what was it like? And I said, “I
thought they were like delightful lunatics, the group.” But I remember they
were always telling me this, pointing to the sky, “You see that sky?” I was
like, “Yeah.” They say, “Beyond that sky, there is another sky, called the
spiritual sky, full of planets.” And I am like, “Wow, man, far-out!” But they
are quoting Bhagavad-gita, paratasmat-bhavanyo-…,  beyond that sky, there is another sky. So
that world, and which is the world of our aspiration, is the forms are the
outcome of the dedicating tendencies. So there form and substance are one.
Here, in this plane, Srila Guru Maharaj is telling us, that if there is insinc
(?), the formal aspect of something, and the substantial, here subjective, the
inner aspect of it, if they are congruous, if they are one, then everything is
okay. But in the event that they are in contradiction, then we put our emphasis
toward the subjective aspect.

  #00:12:19#

Like there is a famous, Nyaya-shastra, nyaya
means logic, so there is the Nyaya-sastra. So there is one type of logic,
called, nagna-matrica-nyaya, which means the logic, or the fallacy, you can
say, the fallacy of the naked mother, the logic of the naked mother, the
fallacy of the naked mother logic. And what that means, is to say that a child
could reasonably, rationally, factually think, “Oh, my mother was once a naked
girl,” they could think that and it would all be true, but we’re being told
here, if you focus on that so-called objective reality, what is just
objectively true, you’ll be deluded from perceiving the subjective aspect, the
reality of what is before you at present. So when the mother is before the
child, she is there on the capacity of the mother, that objectively speaking,
so-called factually speaking, in the past, she was on some other condition,
some other position is irrelevant to the present. So we’re told that sort of
thing should be suppressed. So in the lives of servitors, we have to also deal
with our past, or what sometimes called prarbha-karma, the karma that you stuck
with in this life that you generated, we generated this particular body and
karmic circumstances, before coming in connection with Krishna Consciousness.
So it has so much karmic destiny (in play?). Then someone comes in connection
with Krishna Consciousness. Rupa Goswami says in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu,

  #00:15:11#

kleśa-ghnī
śubha-dā mokṣa-laghutā-kṛt su-durlabhāsāndrānanda-viśeṣātmā śrī-kṛṣṇākarṣiṇī
ca sā(Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu:1.1.17)

  #00:15:18#

He is outlining what is Krishna-bhakti
substantially and what is the outcome, or what are symptoms, what are side
effects, everything is being taken into consideration, beginning with
klesh-agni, saying, the conventional suffering that’s associated with being
embodied, prarabdha-karma, you accumulated karma in this life, he says, [it
will put into that?]. Now, people will say, but we see, devotees are suffering
in different ways, it’s not that you come in connection with Krishna
Consciousness, and you never get the flu again.

  #00:16:06#

When Gurudev was riding on the train, he
would go from Navadwip to Calcutta, when he was Gauredu Brahmachari, and just
like people in modern times they might say about us (?), “Oh, you know, the
harekrishna, there was the harekrishna on the train.”  These are Bengalis, and said that time, they
called them Gaurangas, so they are like, “Hey, gauranga, we gonna talk to the
gauranga.” And they are talking to Gurudev at the time, who is Gaurendu
Brahmachari, and they are saying, “If the devotees, they are devotees they are
supposed to be liberated, how can we see that they get sick. Really, they should
be free from any sort of disease, and just always be healthy. Why should they
be in an unhealthy, diseased condition on any such thing?” And Gurudev answered
by saying, “No, just the opposite, because the devotees they are escaping maya,
they are on the way out the material world, so they should be attacked with
many varieties of things.”

  #00:17:27#

Guru Maharaj would sometimes say also, that
Bamshidas Babaji Maharaj, he in his final, who was revered by Srila Saraswati
Thakur, as being a substantial devotee, a raga-marg-bhakta, and what do we hear
about him? That he is not showing so much the external trimmings-trappings of
the vaiṣṇava, he is in fact, we hear, he is scattering fish scales on the
outside of the ashram, so people will think he is bogus, sometimes they see him
smoking, he offering tea to Gaur-Nityananda. So many people think, “This guy is
totally bogus, we’re not going to go near him, and he’s bad association even.”
But he is verified by Saraswati Thakur as being a substantial raga-marg bhakta
in vatsalya-rasa. And he told his disciples, if by going to see him, and his
way of dress, his ashram, these activities, it will cause you to think of him
offensively, then you’ll be committing an offense towards a great vaiṣṇava, and
that will be very detrimental to your spiritual progress, so better that you
don’t go. But again it was someone who was qualified. In the case of Srila Guru
Maharaj, he could go, observe him, and keep his faith intact. And he said
sometimes Bamshidas Babaji Maharaj would be seen, he would chastise, he’d be
half into the spiritual world and half conscious in this world, and he would
say, cause everyone they are sort of observing him, and Bamshidas Babaji
Maharaj will say, “Rupa Manjari is moving in the plane of service, and she has
some necessity, and you’re all just sitting here doing nothing.” He would say
things like that.

  #00:19:55#

Another time, Gurudev said he saw in the
inner world, Gaur and Nityananda Prabhu were climbing some tree and Bamshidas
Babaji, “Nitay, be careful, Nitaya, be careful!” And he became so concerned
with for the welfare of Nityananda Prabhu, he also climbed the tree, and then
he fell out of the tree onto the ground, broke his back. So in this world he
broke his back, in the spiritual world that’s meaningless to him, that he broke
his back, that does not bother him. It’s not impeding his devotional flow.

  #00:20:31#

The Srimad Bhagavatam tells also of the,
perhaps in the third canto, it says that, “As a drunkers, the caricature of a
drunker, the stereotype as a drunkered, if an actor, comedian, wants to play a
drunker, thye put their coat, half on, half off, and they adopt a particular
behavior, so it says in the Bhagavatam, for a liberated soul, for a liberated
soul, the body is like dress, so whether their body is on or off, half on, half
off, they are unaware of that, those who are intoxicated with Krishna-prem, the
bauty, charm and sweetness fo kKrishna, the nama, rupa, guna lila of Krishna,
they are unaware.

  #00:21:37#

As Bhaktivinod Thakur, sometimes in his
final days, totally naked in his house, if someone came to see him, his
attendant Krishna das would take sme cloth like this, sit him in his chair, and
then put the cloth on him and then bring the people in. And Bhaktivinod Thakur,
they would ask him some question, like, “Can you say something about
Krishna-nam?” And Bhaktivinod half lost in the upper world, would say, “Krishna-nam!”
and fall in the floor fainting.

  #00:22:11#

So Bamshidas Babaji Maharaj like that in his
final days, when his body was riddled with disease, Guru Maharaj said, he would
sometimes say to the people, “Look, this is your vaiṣṇava! Look at your vaiṣṇava,
you think I am a vaisnava, look at how I am suffering!” To sort of you could
say test their faith about form vs. substance, what’s going on on (?) the
inside.

  #00:22:48#

So in that śloka of the Vraja-gopis, from
the Gopi-gita, they told Krishna,

  #00:22:59#

tava
kathāmṛtaṁ tapta-jīvanaṁkavibhir īḍitaṁ
kalmaṣāpahamśravaṇa-maṅgalaṁ
śrīmad ātataṁbhuvi gṛṇanti
ye bhūri-dā janāḥ(Srimad
Bhagavatam: 10.31.9)

  #00:23:12#

Like Rupa Goswami said, in the end of
suffering, “Now we understand what suffering is. Suffering is on account of
forgetfulness of Krishna, that is the root cause of all suffering”. bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syād/īśād
apetasya viparyayo ’smṛtiḥ…(Srimad Bhagavatam: 11.2.37).

  #00:23:38#

And that’s why we
experience anxiety, kuntha, the Vai-kuntha, the world that’s free from that
anxiety, is the world where one is lost in remembrance of Krishna. So the
Vraja-gopis say, “Hearing, we want to hear, and not only want to hear talks
about Krishna, but really, where that appears in the Srimad Bhagavatam, they
actually aould like to speak to Krishna personally and hear something from Him.
When they say, tava-kathamrtam, hearing about you, in one sense it’s a little
bit of under-statement (?), they are searching for Krishna and they would like
to hear something from Him. And they are saying, “Hearing about you and from
you, and hearing your voice, that’s puts an end to all suffering.” They are
also suffering, but their suffering is of a different type. They are suffering
the fire of separation. …bāhye viṣa-jvālā haya, bhitare ānanda-maya,
kṛṣṇa-premāra adbhuta carita (Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta: Madhya-līlā, 2.50)

  #00:24:58#

That’s mentioned in the
Chaitanya-charitamrta, that the adbuta-charit, the wonderful quality,
characteristic of the Krishna-prem, is externally, is like one has been
poisoned. They are suffering to the extreme. Like these Vraja-gopis mentioned
Krishna in one of his pastimes he swallowed the forest fire, he did it twice.
But it’s pointed out maybe Visvanath Chakravarti Thakur, he says, “Actually though
the fire of separation burning in their hearts is millions of times more
intense then any type of fire in this world.” That sort of fire is burning
inside of them, so they are appealing to Kri[shna]. They are saying, “Coming in
connection with you is supposed to put an end to suffering”, but we are so
externally oriented, we are thinking about convetional suffering, they are so
far beyond that, their suffering is viraha-bhav, the fire of separation, that’s
causing pain in their hearts. So it says, yes, although externally it appears
that the devotees are suffering, internally they are relishing ecstatic joy.
Bahe, means externally, visha-jala hoy, like they are on fire, like they’ve
been poisoned, bhitare ananda moi, internally they are in ecstatic condition.

  #00:27:10#

So we consider that the better aspect of
ourselves, the real and substantial aspect of ourselves is the outcome of the
mercy of Guru and vaiṣṇava. We are not thinking of ourselves independently of
that conception, that we brought something to the table, in terms of our
acquired karmic tendencies, that we have something to offer, that’s not the
actual thinking of a devotee. We are told the other day, Guru Maharaj is
saying, we’re like clay, and the mercy of Guru in infusing the clay with some
life, what is that life? Dedicating tendency. Seva-mayoyam loka. At the conclusion of the Kalyana-kalpataru,
Bhaktivinod Thakur is talking about he nam-hatta, which is been rendered as the
market place of the Holy Name of Krishna, of Nityanada Prabhu and Bhaktivinod
Thakur describes himself as a sweeper at that nama-hatta. What’s the job of the
sweeper? To sweep out the dirty things. So if you take it as a metaphore for
the sampradaya in this line, it’s a seva that he is performing. But Srila
Guru Maharaj points out that hearing that Srila Saraswati Thakur he said, “If
Bhaktivinod Thakur is a sweeper in the nama-hatta of Nityananda Prabhu, then I
am one of the straws in his broom, that’s my position, to be a straw in that
broom.” And then Guru Maharaj said something very telling, “If we take it, that
this is a sincere expression of his”, in other worlds, it’s not a clever
reportee, or just clver use of world, a clever thing to say, but if we take it
that what he is saying is sincere, then, “Bhaktivinod is in that position, then
I am one of the straws in his broom.”

  #00:30:05#

This is literally
trnad-api-sunichena…humbler than a blade of grass, ne of the straw, trna. Guru
Maharaj says, “Then we can understand what is the unit of measurement by which
the swarup is constructed.” We say, jive svarup hoy krishnera nitya das, the
unit of measurement, of the construction of the swarup. What is it constructed
out of, as they told, the biological expression of the soul’s delusion is the
body in the world of exploitation, in that plane, the swarup is the spiritually
substantive from that’s an expression of acquired, accumulated dedicating
tendencies. So in that plane, that’s why, from and substance are one. The
subjective and the objective are one there. 

  #00:31:32#

Proper oneness conception

  #00:31:33#

Like we have a knee-jerk reaction, being
raised in the Krishna Consciousness movement, whenever we hear about oneness.
So once Guru Maharaj was explaining type of sannyas name and it had the word aloka, and the word para-dveiti. So Guru
Maharaj said, “What does that mean?” It seems to be saying, “The most
illuminating concept is oneness, the highest concept is oneness.” [Jai Srila
Bhakti Bimal Avadhut Maharaj ki jay!] And Guru Maharaj is saying, “Yes, the
highest conception is oneness.” And everyone were “Uh!” like. We heard
Prabhupad railed against this type of talk so many times. And Srila Guru Maharaj being the leading authority on
Gaudia-siddhantha, and that’s why he is given a name Sridhar, Bhakti Raksak,
the Guardian of Devotion. And Sridhar, one of the implications of the name
Sridhar, Sridhar Swami, his opinion is above all others. And he is saying, “Oneness is the highest conception.”
But then this how Guru Maharaj starts extracting. Just like Vraja-gopis,
extract from slokas, from dialogues with Krishna so many, they take the meaning
to the highest aspect of the subjective plane. As you say subjective, Guru
Maharaj uses another word, “super-subjective” and then he has another word,
“super-super-subjective”. He goes from the subjective word, to the
super-subjective word, is a lower hemisphere of Vaikuntha, to the
super-super-subjective word, that’s the aprakrta-lila of Krishna.

  #00:33:51#

But anyway, so Guru Maharaj explained in
this way, he said, “What is that oneness, that is the highest conception? It’s...ekātmānāv api bhuvi purā deha-bhedaṁ gatau
tau caitanyākhyaṁ prakaṭam adhunā tad-dvayaṁ…(Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta:
Ādi-līlā, 1.5) or …rādhā-bhāva-dyuti-suvalitaṁ naumi kṛṣṇa-svarūpam so he’s saying, when Krishna and Radharani come
together, as Mahaprabhu, in the light of the conception of that oneness, that
devotional mood, rādhā-bhāva-dyuti, it’s that light, that light, which is illuminating
everything, that’s the highest conception of oneness. The union of Radha and
Krishna. śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya rādhā-kṛṣṇa
nahe anya, and the appearance of the Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

  #00:35:07#

So our position will be that we mentioned
this the other day, Srila Guru Maharaj telling, how even in practical
circumstances, there is, by the aspiring devotees, there is an element of
parakiya. And how did he express that? Put it in this way by saying, karmicly
speaking, just in the vedic conception, the husband has some right to assert
over the wife, so the karmic circumstances we’ve generated and find ourselves
surrounded in, they have some right to assert themselves over us, we’ve
generated them. We’re responsible for the circumstances we’re at. When we may
say, “Then it’s inescapable.” In a certain way. But Guru Maharaj said, “Just as
the husband has the right over the wife, she has a paramour in her heart,
externally she is appearing to be dutifully responsible to the husband, the
circumstances, internally she is given over to the paramour.” Guru Maharaj’s
example is, “We are in the midst of karmic circumstances, that are asserting
their rights, their demands over us, and that’s being exacted apparently. But
internally in the heart, is the culture of Krishna Consciousness, we’re given
over to the paramour, who in this sense is Krishna.”

  #00:36:59#

So anyway these are some things that come to
my mind, when you say that, I don’t know, if you have some specific thing that
you want addressed. But…Hare Krishna. Does that answer your question at all?

  #00:37:26#

Srimati Bhakti Lalita Devi: Yes.

  #00:37:27#

Srila B.S. Goswami Maharaj: Okay. Any other
question?

  #00:37:29#

Senses: what are they meant for?

  #00:37:34#

Srila B.B. Avadhut Maharaj: I have a
question. When we film Bhadrinath story. There is a question or Guru Maharaj
specifically talking about, Parikshit Maharaj is talking about senses. In this
world senses are...It’s like everybody are trying to restrain their senses,
trying to control them, but then he is talking about reality. Plane where the
sense are veg (?), how did it come to Suka? How did he get that experience from
the brahmanistha platform? […]

  #00:38:29#

Srila B.S. Goswami Maharaj: Well, one thing
we have to say. First is that, Krishna is known as Rishikesh, so we…, so there
is two big slokas about pure devotion. One of them is

  #00:38:46#

rishikena… So
the question comes in the Veda-stuti, the eighty seventh chapter of the tenth
canto Prayers of the Personified Vedas,
they say, Parikshit Maharaj and Sukadev they are saying, “If the tongue is made
out flash, the voice box, sound, ether, all these are from gross to subtle,
still they are mundane elements, how can they vibrate anything spiritual?” It
seems whatever they will produce it will also be mundane. They are mundane
instruments and they produce mundane things. So they will produce, the end
result will be mundane sound. But you’re telling us, there is spiritual sound
and anavrtti sabda, through sound one
can become liberated. It doesn’t…Please, explain that.

  #00:39:45#

And it’s interesting, cause it intersects
with Guru Maharaja’s repeated quoting of Jagadananda Pandit’s Prema-vivarta, where it says, namaksara bahiraya bate nama kabhu naya,
he says, “The sound of the Holy Name is never, the holy name, kabhu naya, it doesn’t say sometimes,
it’s never, so it’s not the sound, it’s never the sound, it’s spirit infused
sound.” So the shorter, that’s the longest chapter in the tenth canto, of all
of them. Many Upanishad speak. It’s very long and profound. In short, in a nutshell,
Guru Maharaj is saying, “Yes, the finite cannot generate the infinite. Any
amount of mundane of mundane cannot generate the spiritual. But the spiritual
can use the finite to express something.” So it can come from up to down. It
will never go from down to up. Also, vox popula is not vox Dei. The voice of
the people is not the voice of God. So for to be infused, spirit can be sent,
we’re discussing. There is Gopi-gita. And Vishvanath as I told earlier, he
makes an observation, saying, “These gopīs were praying for Krishna to reveal
Himself to them. They are living proof of the Upanishad śloka. Yam evaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyas/tasyaiṣa ātmā
vivṛṇute tanūṁ svām (Kaṭha Upaniṣad, 2.23) and Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, 3.2.3). He
reveals himself to whom he choses, through whom he choses.

  #00:41:41#

So Srila Guru Maharaj, he will say, and Vishvanath
Chakravarti Thakur says in his commentaries, “Really, the subject that’s being
addressed here is why are the such things as sense and sense perception, it
gets it to the very root of it, what is the purpose of seeing, of sight? Like
if here from the revolutionary biologist, they will give the whole scenario,
“Well, the reason, the human beings can see, and seeing the peripheral, the
hunters are coming, so they need to protect themselves and they staying…” They
have this whole idea of why and the ear, and it’s located here, and so when
they get here this way, then their wife would be hear, and sometimes they don’t
want to hear that. I think that’s in their somewhere, I joked, I mean, but you
know you get the idea.

  #00:42:50#

That’s not why you have senses. So this is
part of the answer, the reason you’ve been given senses, ... How can we connect
seeing, they are just flashy eyeballs, the flashy ear, etc. And the answer is,
“No, no, the reason you have eyes is to see Krishna, it’s for spiritual purpose,
the reason you have ears is to hear Hari-katha, the flute sound of Krishna, the
name of Krishna, the reason you have smell, is to smell the aroma.” Every
single sense you have the whole purpose behind it, is o perceive Krishna.
That’s what they are for. And that’s why they’ve been gifted to you, and that’s
why you have this extraordinary opportunity to become liberated in this
lifetime. They are actually not meant for anything else. And we’ll say, “Well,
that’s a fanatical position, that is presented by different devotee, but we’ve
got to be realistic, you know. The bills got to be paid on time.” That’s just
how deluded we are. Yes, you have to give attention to those things in this
world, but to think that the sole purpose of possessing all this sensory capacity
is for a such a low target, is sort of pathetic or not inspiring. So the real
purpose of all of these things is to do that.

  #00:44:36#

Just like in Rukmni’s prayer.

  #00:44:42#

śrutvā guṇān bhuvana-sundara śṛṇvatāṁ tenirviśya karṇa-vivarair
harato ’ṅga-tāpamrūpaṁ dṛśāṁ
dṛśimatām akhilārtha-lābhaṁtvayy
acyutāviśati cittam apatrapaṁ me(Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,
10.52.37)

  #00:44:50#

And it get haratam tapa (?), the same thing
as the kamasha-apaham, of the Vraja-gopis statement, and statement of Rupa
Goswami, is saying, “Relieving the suffering…” And we’re back to thing, “But we
see that they are suffering”, then it must mean something else, it must have
the deeper level meaning to that. But anyway here Rukmini is saying, “Now I
understand hearing about you, and out of the sound of hearing about you, the
divine sound of hearing your description, your form appeared to me. And now I
understand you’re the most beautiful thing in the world. Now I understand, why
we have eyes, now I understand, why we have ears.”

  #00:45:32#

Sukadev
has been selected as an instrument to broadcast the Srimad Bhagavatam

  #00:45:33#

Now the case of Sukadev Goswami. According to Srila Guru Maharaj, he’s been
selected to be the loudspeaker to broadcast the Krishna conception, and the
pastimes of Krishna, particularly with Radharani and Vraja-gopis, because he’s
ostensively not a devotee. He says in the beginning to Pariksit Maharaj
when they meet, when all the sages have assembled from all the Universe offered
him a presidential sit. He says, paranistitopi nirgune uttama śloka lilaya(?),
so he says, parinistita nairgunera, nirguna, everyone knows, he’s legendary,
it’s the legendary Sukadev Goswami, liberated in the womb of his mother, said,
“I started out in the nirguna plane, because up to that point everyone else who
had, it says, burini buri karmani (?), everyone was giving different advice to
Pariksit Maharaj. Someone is saying, “You should do yoga.” Others saying, “Penance,
austerity, meditate.” And Guru Maharaj says, “Why?” Because they are sincerely
advising him in terms of what was helpful to them. So they are saying, this is
what worked for me and becoming free from mundane attachment. So they are
recommended that. Pariksit Maharaja’s response was to say, “I have seven days,
I have very short time, so I want you to all get together and form a consensus
and then present your unanimous verdict to me. After you meet as a group and
discuss all the possible different types of spiritual advice, put it together
and give me the unanimous verdict of all of you.” That’s when Sukadev arrived.
And then they saw, how perfect is this. The person who is really qualified to
answer that has arrived.

  #00:48:00#

And then what does Sukadev say by way of
introduction, “Yes, as you all know, I was in the nirguna plane, I didn’t have
to engage in some sort of practice to overcome my mundane tendencies, cause I
didn’t have any.” That’s why he is selected. But he is not yet a devotee. So he’s
saying. And you understand, through one person they just cleaned the whole (?).
He is saying, “I have no mundane tendencies.” Then they say, “Well, let’s hear
what he has to say then.” And that’s when he says, uttama śloka lilaya… “When I
heard this uttama śloka, incredibly beautiful wonderful songs of Krishna, and
my mind, heart, consciousness was carried away to another domain, that I didn’t
know existed previously.” So that mean he was in the nirguna plane on the
outskirts, and he went higher into that super-super-subjective world, he had a
glimpse of that, and he’s saying, “And that captured me heart and soul,
captured my consciousness.”

  #00:49:25#

But Guru Maharaj, when I asked him a
question once, “Why does it say in the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindu, at the end of the
chapter, a neutral love of God, shanta-rasa, it says, Bilvamangal Thakur, and
Sukadev Goswami are the two best examples. And Sukadev Goswami, he is giving
all this the madhura-rasa pastimes of Krishna, and here it’s saying, he’s given
example of shanta-rasa, it seems to be ontologically perplexing, and Guru
Maharaj said, “Yes, he was used as a vehicle, an instrument to broadcast these
things and after they were broadcast, he said, he went back to his group.” So
he was used for sometime to broadcast something that was in a sense, like the
hanuveti, sukaveti, vyasoveti, (?). I said here to Guru Maharaj and we laughed,
cause I said, here Shiva says, “I know the meaning, Sukadev knows and Vyas
knows.” And I said, “Maharaj, now you’re saying that Suka doesn’t know.” And he
laughed, and he said, “To a certain point.” And he took it even further,
“Shiva, he knows to a certain extend.” 
These are things that he said. So he’s saying he was used instrumentally
to broadcast these things. When that was finished, then he, like when someone
will get inspired and expressed something, when that is finished they are back
in their former position.

  #00:51:12#

Srila B.B. Avadhut Maharaj: But when Vyas
rejected his … ten slokas…(?)

  #00:51:20#

Srila B.S. Goswami Maharaj: The tenth ślokas
go from Narada to Vyas.

  #00:51:23#

Srila B.B. Avadhut Maharaj: Right. Vyas
comprehends those concepts fully or it’s…

  #00:51:28#

Srila B.S. Goswami Maharaj: No, it’s like
mantram, Narada told in seed form within those ten slokas, and then told, “You
meditate on this, and it will come out.” Then Vyas he meditates on the banks of
the Saraswati, then this divine inspiration comes to him. And that śloka say,
aham vettmi suka vetti, vyasa vetti navetti va, Vyas may know or may not know,
so he’s also an instrument, and Mahaprabhu, that śloka comes from Mahaprabhu,
that śloka comes from Mahaprabhu telling Sanatan Goswami, that what’s passing
through me, I may not be fully aware of that. But what I am certain of is
Krishna wants to grace you through me. That much I hundred percent certain of,
but what’s passing through me, I don’t claim to understand all of that fully,
it’s infinite. He says, even one letter, one word of the Bhagavatam is
infinite. As Sanatan was praising him, having given the sixty explanations of
the atmarama śloka at that point. Then Sanatan would say, “This is divine,
you’re God Himsef.” And Mahaprabhu, “No, no, saying, it’s your necessity,
that’s drawing this through me.” And then he gave the sixty first explanation.
So we can see also, that Vyas has some necessity, he’s filling some
despondency, despite having given Mahabharata, compiling all of these Vedic
literatures, something in his, there is a disturbance in his heart, Narada
comes and says, “I know why, because even though, you’ve presented Krishna
conception in different places, and although it was not your intention,
inadvertently people could interpret that in a mundane way, with some mundane
color, and in the name of religion they’ll remain bound. That’s the difficulty.”
It will be religion, which keeps people, that will be the very thing, that
keeps people bound to the world. And will be quoting your name as the
sanctioner.

  #00:54:08#

Love actually

  #00:54:09#

Srila B.B. Avadhut Maharaj: Why is it
bound?

  #00:54:11#

Srila B.S. Goswami Maharaj:Because as told inadvertently gave
people the idea that you can perform some religious, ritualistic activities,
etc. and be happy in this world. What would be the need to immigrate to the
upper world? If every thing you could possibly want can be achieved here
through regulating yourself according to the Scriptures. That’s why at he heart of the Bhagavatam, he is saying, tad eva tad
achyuta priya, achyuta priya and svarupena vivasthiti, saying, you’ve not given
them the impression or the understanding that the swarup, and we’re back to the
original question, the form, you
have a form in the spiritual world, where the actual type of loving
relationships you seek, loving exchange can be fully properly realized.
…muktir
hitvānyathā rūpaṁ/sva-rūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, 2.10.6)

  #00:55:28#

Otherwise people have the idea, just as
they, you know that, mukti or liberation means become free from the body and
all the suffering that’s attributed to being embodied, and then merging into
some sort of impersonal existence. So Srila Prabhupad in his Bhagavatam
commentary, in the first śloka the Srimad Bhagavatam says that mayavadis
indirectly give emphasis for mundane sexual affairs, because they deny he
possibility of the erotic principle being present in the spiritual domain,
which is the heart of the matter of the Krishna-lila. Goes through ten cantos
to bring you to this point of understanding that the Erotic Principle and
Unalloyed Devotion as put by professor Sannyal under the auspices of
Saraswati Thakur.

  #00:56:36#

Obiously, it’s something that has to be
discussed in a very cautious and delicate way, but that’s at the root of the
matter. And so it means sensuous capacity and engagement. So again, that’s
Sukadev, who is the loudspeaker for the Bhagavatam. Why every event is there?
Just like in this world they say like in a short story. You can’t have any
information in there that is uncritical to the story or this is not such a
short story, but everything there is critical. So earlier we hear, what seems
to be in one sense to just be some story, it’s interesting, it’s an anecdotal
story, it has the peripheral interest that Vyas is running after Sukadev, the
divya-devis are bathing and they are naked, when Sukadev goes by, they make eye
contact and they don’t’ bother to cover themselves. And then when Vedavyas
comes, the great Vedavyas, they cover themselves, out of shyness and shame. And
Vyas, observing this said, “I don’t understand why?” And they are saying, “Well,
that boy, we could see in his eyes, no lust, there is nothing mundane there.
Just like a little child.” That type of innocence. He doesn’t see a naked
woman, the form of a naked woman.” So there is no necessity for the…We see. And
you…Vedavyas, “You’re talking to me?!” And you know, “Don’t mind it, but we’re
covering.”

  #00:58:52#

So you think, “Oh, it’s an interesting
story.” But it sets up later, so when Sukadev comes, he is that Sukadev, who
has that, just a little children, that it’s naked woman or any such thing. That
Sukadev says, so we’ve already established, he is in a nirguna plane, above
tama, raja and sattva-gun, has no interest, even remotely, he’s no even like
trace amounts of exploiting tendency toward women, sexuality, and he’s saying,
“I heard these pastimes of Krishna with Radharani and Vraja-gopis, and was
captured heart and soul and carried away to another world, that I couldn’t even
conceive existed previously. That’s why it comes from him. That certifies that
then it cannot be the mundane affairs of men and women in this world. Then one may say, “You mean then there is erotic
potential in the spiritual existence with the Supreme Entity?” That is a
mind-blowing conclusion, but that’s what is being suggested in a most cautious
careful way.

  #01:00:27#

Srila B.B. Avadhut Maharaj:So can we say that that’s sort of news
or message, the highest principle key of the Bhagavatam?

  #01:00:40#

Srila B.S. Goswami Maharaj: Guru Maharaj put
it in his sloka:

  #01:00:43#

yadamiya mahima sri-bhagavatam kathayampratipadam
anubhutam apy alabdhabhideyatad
akhila-rasa-murteh syama-lilavalambammadhura-rasabdhi
radha-pada-padmam prapadye(Srila
Sridhar Maharaj)

  #01:01:01#

So he is saying, “The Bhagavatam, whatever
you may see there, as we told on the Nrisimhadev in a little summary. Well, we
heard in the first canto, second canto, so many avatars, incarnations, Sukadev
to Pariksit Maharaj, these great sages of Siddha-loka having discussions,
Kapila to Devahuti in the third canto, Puranjana in the forth canto, the four
Kumaras, the fifth canto, the hellish planets, all these different things are
described, the prayers, Rishabhadev instructions to his son, Ajamil in the
sixth canto, Chitraketu, that pastime, seventh canto, Prahlad, eight canto,
Vamadev, Mohini Murti, ninth canto, Rama-lila, Ambarish, everything. What is
Guru Maharaj saying in his sloka? …pratipadam
anubhutam apy alabdhabhideya. At every step of the way, every chapter,
every pastime, it’s meant to take you to one place. What is that? Sri rasha
pada padmam prapadye. To surrend yourself to the lotus feet of Sriati
Radharani, and engage in Radha-dasyam, to serve her holy lotus feet. That’s the
purpose of all of this, of every story of every talk, of every indication of
the Book. That’s pretty extraordinary. That’s what is revited (?) of
nam-sankirttan, of everything, why you have senses.

  #01:02:42#

Srila B.B. Avadhut Maharaj: Did Maharaj
Pariksit achieve that level?

  #01:02:50#

Srila B.S. Goswami Maharaj:  These, it’s all lila, pastimes, so, as I told
recently, Arjun, when he sees the Viratha-rupas, apologizing to Krishna for
being too friendly. But Krishna likes Arjun to be friendly, no apology
necessary. But he feels like that, like, “You know, I forgot you were God, I am
really sorry about that, I’ll try, next okay? Anyway, it’s lunch time.” It’s
hard to like when someone just shows the Viratha-rupa, how do you respond to
that? So he is saying, “Forgive me for being too friendly, and that one time I
was like maybe a little, you know, insulting.” But Krishna, we hear in other
place, that’s what he likes, is when you forget his divine aspect, and deal
with him in a friendly way or even more than friendly. So, what was that you said?

  #01:03:56#

Pariksit Maharaj: The mystery of
his leaving the world

  #01:03:57#

Srila B.B. Avadhut Maharaj: Did Pariksit
Maharaj…?

  #01:03:58#

Srila B.S. Goswami Maharaj: Oh, Maharaj
Pariksit. So Pariksit Maharaj, remember, his mother is Uttara. And in the
beginning of the Bhagavatam, she is running to Krishna, mahayogi…, the Pandavas
are there with Krishna, the war is finished, and Uttara comes running, and
everyone are shocked and what’s happening, there is a brahmastra is chasing
her, and she is pregnant with Pariksit Maharaj. So Krishna saves him. He enters
into the expanse, enters into the womb of Uttara, the brahmastra comes, the
Pariksit. He has, we’re told, he has some glimpse of the Lord at that time, so
Pariksit means, one who examines, pariksa,
so he is always examining everyone and everything, he is always remembering
that glimpse. Bhaktivinod Thakur says, like we saw lightening earlier in the
night, and we go, lightening comes. And just for a moment, everything is
illumined, and you see, and then vanishes. So Krishna’s appearance has been
described like that in different ways. Anyway, that’s part of the back-story,
driving Pariksit Maharaj in life, why he is such a stuit (?) observer and
examiner.

  #01:05:38#

So that Pariksit Maharaj, who after all he
listened (?) from Sukadev Goswami, we’re told at the end, now Sukadev as Guru
Maharaj said, he is going back, where he was before, wonders off, all the sages
are living and Tarksa, Tarksaka, snake, so called snake-bird, who is supposed
to kill Pariksit Maharaj. He sees these sages are living, and he also sees,
there is Jaimini Rishi, and he sees different ones. And he sees, I forget,
whether it’s Agastya or who, who can counteract the poison, the snake venom. So
he takes the form of a brahman and he, it’s just like India. Maharaj, I want to
give one gift to you. And he is giving him nice things, like Sagar Maharaj
pointed out in Garga-samhita, so many sages like to sit up in the mountains,
being really away from  the world. They’d
never seen sugar before, they thought it was sand. They are going, “This sand
is incredible. Did you try the sand?”

  #01:06:59#

So he is giving gold, all kinds of things,
“Maharaj, you take, I saw you in the Bhagavatam. You’re…you know.  This is my situation.” He gives them gifts
and gets them away from there. Now when everyone is gone, except for Jaimini
Rishi is hiding in the bushes. There is always one really smart person hiding
in the bushes. It’s just the truth. So he is hiding in the bushes. So this
Tarksaka, he comes in the form of brahmin, “Maharaj, Parikit Maharaj, I give my
dandavat-pranam.” And he bows down and then his teeth come out, like the
vampire, the teeth come out, and he bites him on the lotus foot. But this is
how the Bhagavatam. Someone will say, “Oh, I heard another…” Yes, there are
other versions in other Puranas and other places, and Guru Maharaj says, it’s
like hypnotism, as the hypnotist compels one to see, that he will see. This is
the description in Srimad Bhagavatam.

  #01:08:24#

So then, but before that…Just think, those
sages, they left, he placated them, and then he comes, how much time could that
be? From them going to him coming, giving his dandavat, and biting the lotus
feet of Pariksit Maharaj, infusing, injecting venom, and his body explodes in
flames. But before that time, just that time, we hear in Brihad-bhagavatmrtam,
that Jaimini Rishi who is hiding in the bushes. Before that happened, he is
telling Janamejoy, the son of Pariksit Maharaj, “Your grandmother, Uttara, like
hse came running in the beginning of the Bhagavatam, she came running again to
Pariksit Maharaj and said, “Son, you’ve just heard all this nectar from
Sukadev, can you share some with your dear mother?” So then Pariksit Maharaj
says, “I am glad that you came, because one by one I was turning off my
senses.” Like we go round, turn off the water, turn off the light, turn off the
fan, close the window. So he said, “I was just going to shut down all of my
senses. Because by the time Tarksaka gets there, Pariksit Maharaj, what’s left
is really a body. He is maintaining it, but it’s completely at that point disconnected
from his body. So he is biting, the body burst in flame, but Pariksit Maharaj
he is extraordinary. But so then Uttara sits there, and we hear, and it was
also indicated earlier in the Bhagavatam, and Sanatan Goswami reveals that. In
this one sloka, mystic sloka, where are all these divine ladies are mentioned ,
her is there, but there is another name there, that can indicate her. So that
means that her name, in this sense, is indicated twice, which is a way of in a
subtle, mystical, incriptic way, saying, “She has some extraordinary qualities
and capacity, as an intended recipient of madhura-rasa.” So she is the one, who
says to Pariksit Maharaj told the whole Brhad-bhagavatmrtam to. That was
overheard by Jaimini Rishi in the bushes. He is telling Janamejoy what Pariksit
Maharaj told your grandmother. And it’s Uttara, after the first part, she says,
“Now that you’ve told me so much about the spiritual world, and all these
gradations of the planetary systems and everything, from gross to subtle and
then into the divine world, of what I hear of the Vaikuntha world and of what I
hear of Radharani and the Vraja-gopis, and Nanda and Yasoda, and Sridam and
Sudam, the type of love they have for Krishna, I just feel in my heart, there
must be some other place, where they live to accommodate them. Because although
the Vaikuntha world is so beautiful and extraordinary, and what I’ve heard you
described and what we hear in the Scriptures, and what the great sages say. But
when I hear about them and that kind of love and affection they have for
Krishna, I’m just convenced I don’t know some sastra to quote or woething, but
in my heart it’s telling me that there is another world that they live in and I
would like you to tlee me about that. And then that’s what the second half, is
the Goloka-mahatmya, the first is different, we can’t go onto all of that. But
so we can understand , she is extraordinary, Pariksit Mahraj is extraordinary,
the expansion and contraction of time and space. Between the time Tarksaka placated
the sages and goes to bite the lotus feel of Pariksit Maharaj, Uttara came
running in and he spoke the whole Brhad-bhagavatamrtam to her. So if that’s
possible what is not possible. And those divine personalities, who are
selected, cat to play this part, how extraordinary they must be, and it’s far
beyond the judgment of the fallen souls myself. But we can understand they are
extraordinary. Hare Krishna!
