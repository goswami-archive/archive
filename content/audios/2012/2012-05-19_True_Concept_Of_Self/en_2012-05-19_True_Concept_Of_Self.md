What are the three Maths that we glorify in Premadhavani? Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math conception. Svarup Damodar and Lalita Sakhi. Can I realize myself as a soul quicker? You can fall from even the highest stage. Dissolve the false concept of self. Body is the biological expression of the soul's delusion. True self.
