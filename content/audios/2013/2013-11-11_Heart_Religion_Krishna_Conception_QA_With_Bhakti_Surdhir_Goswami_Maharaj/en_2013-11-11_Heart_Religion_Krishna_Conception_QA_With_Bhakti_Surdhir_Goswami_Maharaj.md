Content:
1. How to attract the bird of Happiness?

- If Krishna favors you — He takes everything
from you.

- Wealth that remains when the world vanishes —
association of the devotees

- Devotees give the seed of love for the Lord

2. Too high standards – maybe we can proceed
gradually?

- People are ready for the euro-standards of
theism

- Take a leap of faith!

3. Is there any predetermination or karma: some
are rich, some are poor, etc.?

- Predisposition

- Hair on fire: way to approach the spiritual
culture

- Whatever your circumstances are

- Sometimes in the worst conditions you get the
best opportunities: Kali-yuga

- Get the right perspective

4. Why is this world so imperfect in general:
so much sickness and death?

It
	is the world of exploitation – should things be fair here? – No.

Survival
	of the fittest.

Reactions
	of your past times you want to blame on God

5. Why did the Lord created such a world —
maybe, He is incompetent?

- It’s like daughter blaming her problems on her
mother- Thank God for death: if you don’t get it any other way…

6. Why don’t we live in some nice place?

- Still you are in jail.- The opportunity in
Kali-yuga is so desirable that Gods line up to take birth here-
Exploitation vs. Dedication, Devotion- Give heart, get heart-
Love can bring the Supreme Lord under control

7. How to give your heart to Someone I don’t
know? What will He do with my heart?

- Emphasis in Krishna conception is on a devotee –
and association brings Krishna.

8. Why do I need Him?

- Every moment you are searching for Him – not
for the thing or people of this world.

- Hear more to get a more tangible understanding.

9. He has the environment already — how can I
get in?

- He is dynamic. There is no migration quote. He
can reciprocate everyone’s heart.

- Krishna is full in Himself.

- Service draws the attention of Krishna and
nothing can stop Him if He wants to reveal Himself.
