`00:00:07` Why did Rādhārāṇī, after hearing Kṛṣṇa's confession, summon all the Vradja gopi to return to Vṛndāvana? He said, everyone considers themselves supremely fortunate if they get a connection with me.

`00:00:27` And rightfully so. He's Kṛṣṇa. Of course. It makes sense. Karmis, jnanis, yogis, different types of bhaktas, saying, But I consider myself fortunate that I'm the object of that irresistibly sweet flow of love that's in your hearts.

`00:00:53` That's my good fortune. Everyone else's good fortune is to get a connection with me. It's my good fortune that I have a connection with you. Then Guru Maharaj said, We can go now.

`00:01:06` It's clear, he always and only belongs to us. Everything else is a show.
